            Signal Without Origin: On Listening, Mediation, and the Collapse of
            the Natural
        </h2>
        <p class="mt-2">
            Sound has long occupied an ambiguous position in media theory. It is
            at once material and ephemeral, measurable and elusive, resistant to
            capture yet constantly recorded. Unlike the image, sound rarely
            stabilizes into a discrete object. It unfolds, decays, overlaps. To
            listen is therefore never to encounter a thing, but to enter a
            process already in motion.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-4">
            In contemporary media environments, this instability becomes a
            structural condition rather than a limitation. The proliferation of
            sensors, microphones, and computational listening systems has
            detached sound from both source and intention. What we increasingly
            encounter are signals without origins: acoustic events severed from
            their causes, recomposed through chains of technical mediation.
            Field recordings circulate as data; environments are rendered as
            spectra; presence becomes an effect of signal processing rather than
            physical proximity.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-4">
            This shift complicates inherited distinctions between nature and
            technology. The “natural soundscape,” once imagined as an external,
            pre-medial domain, is now inseparable from the apparatus that
            captures it. Wind recorded through a condenser microphone is already
            filtered, framed, discretized. Additive synthesis makes this
            explicit by reconstructing sound from its components, refusing the
            illusion of wholeness. Nature, in this context, does not
            disappear—it is decomposed, analyzed, and reassembled as structure.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-4">
            Listening, then, is no longer a passive reception but an active
            negotiation with layers of mediation. Media theorists have noted
            that technologies of sound do not merely transmit information; they
            produce new regimes of perception. What can be heard, and how it is
            heard, is conditioned by technical standards, formats, and
            infrastructures. The ear is trained by codecs as much as by culture.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-4">
            Identity enters this field obliquely. Voices stripped of semantic
            clarity persist as timbre, rhythm, and noise. In automated listening
            systems—speech recognition, biometric surveillance, algorithmic
            moderation—identity is no longer tied to meaning but to pattern. The
            subject becomes a bundle of frequencies, a statistical profile
            extracted from acoustic residue. What remains is not expression but
            trace.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-4">
            Within this context, artistic practices that work with sound are
            less concerned with representation than with exposure. They
            foreground mediation rather than conceal it, treating noise,
            distortion, and failure as epistemic tools. Glitches, dropouts, and
            spectral smearing are not aesthetic accidents but moments where the
            system reveals itself—where listening becomes reflexive.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-4">
            To work with sound today is therefore to work with limits: the
            limits of perception, of documentation, of authorship. It is to
            accept that no signal arrives untouched, that every recording is
            already an interpretation, and that listening itself is a
            historically and technically situated act. What emerges from this
            acceptance is not clarity, but texture—dense, unstable, and
            resistant to closure.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-4">
            In the end, sound does not offer access to an unmediated real.
            Instead, it maps the conditions under which reality becomes audible
            at all. To listen carefully is not to recover an origin, but to
            trace the infrastructures that make hearing possible—and to
            recognize, within their noise, the contours of a world continuously
            rewritten by its own signals.

            Becoming Interface: Cyborgs After the Human
        </h2>
        <p class="mt-2">
            The cyborg no longer belongs to the future. It has slipped quietly
            into the present, not as a spectacular fusion of flesh and machine,
            but as an ordinary condition of mediation. Sensors, prosthetics,
            algorithms, and networks are no longer external tools; they are
            environments in which subjectivity is continuously produced. The
            cyborg is not a figure—it is a situation.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-4">
            Early cybernetic imaginaries framed the cyborg as enhancement: a
            body improved, optimized, extended beyond biological limits.
            Contemporary realities suggest something more ambiguous. Integration
            does not simply add capacity; it redistributes agency.
            Decision-making migrates into systems, perception is filtered
            through interfaces, and action becomes the outcome of negotiations
            between organic intention and machinic constraint. The human is not
            upgraded so much as reconfigured.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-4">
            This reconfiguration destabilizes the boundary between inside and
            outside. Devices once worn are now embedded; software once consulted
            now anticipates. Recommendation engines, biometric authentication,
            and automated sensing systems operate beneath the threshold of
            conscious awareness. The cyborg condition is defined less by visible
            augmentation than by latency—the temporal gap between stimulus and
            response, increasingly managed by non-human processes.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-4">
            Media theory has long emphasized that technologies shape perception.
            In the cyborg context, this shaping becomes recursive. Systems
            designed to read bodies—tracking movement, voice, affect—also train
            bodies to be legible. Gestures adapt to sensors; speech adapts to
            recognition models; behavior aligns with metrics. The body learns to
            perform itself for machines, while machines learn to model bodies
            statistically. Identity emerges at this interface, neither fully
            embodied nor fully abstract.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-4">
            Nature, traditionally positioned as the cyborg’s opposite, is
            similarly re-coded. Environmental sensors, satellite imaging, and
            predictive models transform ecosystems into streams of data.
            Climate, weather, and terrain are not encountered directly but
            through dashboards and simulations. The cyborg does not leave nature
            behind; it absorbs nature into informational systems, rendering it
            actionable, optimizable, and governable.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-4">
            Sound offers a particularly revealing site for this transformation.
            Voices are parsed for emotion, authenticity, and risk. Acoustic
            signatures function as biometric keys. Listening becomes automated,
            continuous, and asymmetrical. In this context, the cyborg is not
            merely the speaker with a microphone, but the listener embedded in
            infrastructure—an ear extended into code, listening without hearing.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-4">
            Artistic practices engaging with cyborg themes often resist the
            rhetoric of seamless integration. Instead, they foreground friction:
            glitches, feedback loops, misreadings. These moments expose the
            contingency of hybrid systems and the violence implicit in
            standardization. To be misrecognized by a machine is to encounter
            the limits of machinic knowledge—and, by extension, the instability
            of one’s own mediated identity.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-4">
            The cyborg, then, should not be understood as a final state or
            coherent subject. It is a provisional alignment, constantly
            recalibrated by updates, patches, and failures. Its politics are
            unresolved. While cyborg systems promise efficiency and control,
            they also generate opacity and dependency. Agency is distributed,
            but responsibility remains unevenly assigned.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-4">
            To think with the cyborg today is to abandon fantasies of autonomy
            and purity. It is to accept that subjectivity is assembled across
            biological, technical, and institutional layers. The question is no
            longer whether we become cyborgs, but how these assemblages are
            designed, who controls their parameters, and what forms of life they
            permit—or exclude.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-4">
            In this sense, the cyborg is not a myth of transcendence, but a
            diagnostic tool. It reveals the conditions under which the human
            persists, mutates, or dissolves within systems that increasingly
            think, listen, and act alongside us.
