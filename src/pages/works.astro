            Drift Studies (I–IV)
        </h2>
        <p class="mt-2">
            A sequence of recordings gathered from transitional
            landscapes—riverbanks, peripheral highways, abandoned
            shorelines—where sound refuses to stabilize into place. Each piece
            unfolds as a slow erosion of reference, replacing location with
            duration and memory with residue.
        </p>
        <h2 class="text-lg font-semibold tracking-tight mt-4">
            Green Noise for Disappearing Forests
        </h2>
        <p class="mt-2">
            An additive reconstruction of environmental recordings filtered
            until natural sound collapses into abstraction. Birds, wind, and
            insects persist only as spectral hints, questioning whether “nature”
            survives its own documentation.
        </p>
        <h2 class="text-lg font-semibold tracking-tight mt-4">
            Unlicensed Frequencies
        </h2>
        <p class="mt-2">
            A series of short-form works built from intercepted broadcasts,
            electromagnetic interference, and urban hum. Identity here is
            procedural: voices are stripped of language, leaving rhythm, timbre,
            and signal artifacts as the only remaining markers.
        </p>
        <h2 class="text-lg font-semibold tracking-tight mt-4">
            Studies on Listening Fatigue
        </h2>
        <p class="mt-2">
            An investigation into overexposure and attenuation. Extended tones
            derived from field recordings are stretched beyond comfort,
            exploring how prolonged listening alters perception, attention, and
            the boundaries of the self.
        </p>
        <h2 class="text-lg font-semibold tracking-tight mt-4">
            Cartographies Without Coordinates
        </h2>
        <p class="mt-2">
            Sound maps generated from walks through non-descript European
            suburbs. GPS data is discarded; orientation emerges only through
            spectral density and temporal drift. The city is rendered as texture
            rather than plan.
        </p>
        <h2 class="text-lg font-semibold tracking-tight mt-4">
            Residual Voices
        </h2>
        <p class="mt-2">
            Fragments of speech collected from public spaces and processed until
            semantic content dissolves. What remains is cadence and
            breath—identity reduced to its acoustic scaffolding.
        </p>
        <h2 class="text-lg font-semibold tracking-tight mt-4">
            Weather as Instrument
        </h2>
        <p class="mt-2">
            A long-term experiment using meteorological data to modulate
            additive synthesis parameters. Wind speed, humidity, and pressure
            become compositional agents, displacing authorship toward
            environmental systems.
