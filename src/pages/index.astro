			Additive synthesis enters not as a technological flourish but as a
			method of analysis. By rebuilding sound from sine components, it
			exposes the politics of timbre: which frequencies are amplified,
			which are suppressed, which are deemed meaningful. The supposedly
			neutral act of listening becomes architectural. Sound is no longer
			continuous but modular, a stack of decisions layered in time. In
			this sense, synthesis does not simulate the real—it interrogates it,
			frequency by frequency.
		</p>
		<p class="mt-4">
			What emerges is neither field recording nor synthesis in their
			conventional forms, but a hybrid practice of spectral writing. Urban
			hums blur into harmonic clouds; insects become unstable oscillators;
			wind turns into a slow-moving chord whose origin is no longer
			locatable. These works resist narrative closure. They do not
			document a place so much as destabilize it, replacing geography with
			topology, site with spectrum.
		</p>
		<p class="mt-4">
			Spectral Textures operates as a platform rather than a genre. It is
			concerned with listening as a critical act, with sound as an index
			of systems—ecological, technical, economic—that exceed human scale.
			Here, texture is not surface but depth: the accumulation of
			micro-events that refuse to resolve into melody or message. To
			listen is to inhabit this density, to accept sound not as
			representation, but as a field of forces continuously under
			construction.
