        <p>
            Spectral Textures is maintained by a loose constellation of artists
            working across Europe, connected less by geography than by shared
            conditions. They move between studios, transit zones, archives, and
            temporary workspaces, carrying microphones, code, and unfinished
            ideas. Membership is unstable by design. Names circulate, disappear,
            reappear under different frequencies.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-4">
            The group’s practice unfolds somewhere between listening and
            construction. Field recordings are treated as signals rather than
            documents; synthesis is approached as a form of writing rather than
            sound design. What matters is not origin but transformation—how
            environments fracture when translated into spectra, how systems
            leave audible traces even when no one is speaking.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-4">
            Spectral Textures is not an institution, label, or collective in any
            formal sense. It functions more like an interference pattern:
            moments of alignment followed by dispersion. Projects emerge,
            overlap briefly, then dissolve back into individual trajectories.
            Authorship remains intentionally blurred. The work is shaped by
            shared tools, shared references, and shared doubts.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-4">
            Operating in a context marked by accelerating infrastructures and
            thinning attention, the group treats listening as a political and
            material act. Sound becomes a way to register pressure—ecological,
            technical, economic—without resolving it into narrative or solution.
            What remains is texture: layered, unstable, and resistant to
            clarity.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-4">
            Spectral Textures should be read less as a platform and more as a
            trace. An ongoing attempt to stay attuned to what passes through,
            resonates briefly, and moves on.
